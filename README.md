# ProjectASM
Arduino Secure SMS Messaging

This project encompasses the use Arduino hardware to encrypt/decrypt SMS messages.
The device will consist of an Arduino using 2G module with an LCD screen to display messages.
The software to control the Arduino will be developed within the Arduino IDE using C/C++.
The encryption system is chosen by us and can be an existing protocol or of our own creation.
There is also an opportunity to extend the project to utilise regular smartphones.

This was a Deakin University, Australia, Project. It was to be completed within an 8 week period as a team.
This in no way Licenced to us, Just our findings over this period.

Please see our working prototype after week 4 here:
